Hangman javascript game

We will be using HTML, CSS and JS files to implement a hangman game.
The game will track wins, letters guessed, and number of guesses.
The game will change a picture and play an aduio file when when the correct word is guessed.
The game should have a theme I have choosen hockey as my theme. 

I will be using objects in my js file. I will have an object for the letters including properties for guessed and if it is in the word. I will also have an object for the goal Word.
